# Machine-learning-analysis-on-Diabetes-dataset

Diabetes dataset ( https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)

Dataset in this repo can found at: diabetes.csv

The Machine Learning Analysis on Diabetes Data.ipynb has the code and the analysis in which we have applied the k-nearest neighbor, decision tree, and na√Øve Bayes Algorithm without any parameter tuning.

Let's do the following activity to understand the analysis in a better way.

Write a report (no longer than a page) for this diabetes dataset giving your analysis of the dataset, your observations, and comments. You can be as innovative as you want. Minimally, the report should include a brief description of the dataset, the number of observations, missing values or not, the testing strategy deployed, the classification accuracy of algorithms, intuition developed by running the notebooks, etc.
